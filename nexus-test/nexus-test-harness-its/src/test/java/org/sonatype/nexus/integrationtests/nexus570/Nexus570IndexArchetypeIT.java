        // Short explanation what (might) happen here
        // 1) for start, indexing of deployed stuff is done async
        // 2) second, superclass of this IT deploys using
        // deployArtifacts( File project, String wagonHint, String deployUrl, Model model ) method
        // that does not wait for async event handlers to calm down, but is important to
        // state that deploy happens in "maven order", POM then JAR (will become important later)
        // 3) third, the "simple-archetype" being deployed has POM that does not state packaging,
        // hence, default "jar" packaging is assumed (this is maven "rule").
        // 4) fourth, the JAR that is deployed 2nd, does have HETA-INF/archetype.xml, present in archetypes only
        // 5) fifth, due to "known problems" for problem "how to detect is an artifact and archetype or not",
        // maven indexer contains a "bit" of heuristics. Maven Archetypes were recognized in many ways,
        // but until recently they had no proper "packaging" set to "maven-archetype". Older archetypes
        // had JAR packaging in POM and only the aforementioned XML was telling they are archetypes and not "plain JARs"
        // actually. Also, there is a mess with "partial archetypes", etc.
        // 6) Finally, sixth, as Nexus receives deploys (POM then JAR), it will kick indexer at every of them
        // but the actually indexed data will "incrementally" become correct: at POM deploy JAR will be not
        // present, so Indexer will create "partial" context based on POM only (hence, packaging will be JAR
        // and for example no classnames will be indexed due to the lack of JAR). On 2nd deploy of JAR,
        // the created context will be complete (as now bot POM and JAR will be present), and packaging
        // will be properly set to "maven-archetype".
        //
        // See the "heuristic" here (MI 5.1.0):
        // https://github.com/apache/maven-indexer/blob/91147a9311b7aef2dce50e581f4fafad710486f3/indexer-core/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/index/creator/MavenArchetypeArtifactInfoIndexCreator.java#L37
        // https://github.com/apache/maven-indexer/blob/91147a9311b7aef2dce50e581f4fafad710486f3/indexer-core/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/index/creator/MinimalArtifactInfoIndexCreator.java#L50
        //
        // So what happened, is that the assertion below got a "hit" from Indexer, but the hit was actually
        // returned from "partially" indexed artifact, and due to JAR not yet indexed, Maven Indexer
        // did it's best: it assumed packaging is JAR, the information told by POM.
        //
        // Solution(s):
        // a) added wait for calm down (should make everything work more reliable even without b))
        // b) added proper packaging to POM of the resource of this IT
        //
