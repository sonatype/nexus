/**
 * A @Inject provider for the HttpClient instances. Word of warning: while this class might make it look like
 * HttpClient injection is doable and is fine, that should not be done in case of Nexus! The contract with Hc4Provider
 * is to ask for a client instance as late as possible (really to perform the request only), and toss it away,
 * do not keep the instance. By always asking for new instance, you are safe and error prone to configuration
 * changes, and posiblity to end up with stale client with regard some global settings like global HTTP Proxy is,
 * and to have your local client defunct. Hence, it is recommended to inject this Provider instead, and execute
 * a #get() method whenever is needed to have a new client instance. Implementation detail: this class is present
 * for "global" use cases only. Whenever you have a {@link org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.storage.remote.RemoteStorageContext}
 * accessibly, you should NOT use this provider, but use {@link Hc4Provider} instead!
