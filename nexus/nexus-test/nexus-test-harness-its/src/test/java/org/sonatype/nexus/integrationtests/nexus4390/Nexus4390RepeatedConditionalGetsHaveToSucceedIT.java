/**
 * This test tests NEXUS-4390 and Nexus' capability to properly respond to repeated conditionalGET requests. We simply
 * request for a resource, "remember" it's timestamp, and repeatedly ask newer version for the same resource using it's
 * timestamp. In related issue, it is seen that in this case, Nexus eventually responds with 404 because of bug handling
 * the conditional GET.
