import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

/**
 * Before you continue using this class, stop and read carefully its description. This "smart" lock is NOT an improved
 * implementation of Java's ReentrantReadWriteLock in any way. It does NOT implement the unsupported atomic
 * lock-upgrade. All this class allows is following pattern:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   ...
 *   lock.lockShared();
 *   try {
 *     ...
 *     lock.lockExclusively();
 *     try {
 *       ...
 *     } finally {
 *       lock.unlock();
 *     }
 *     ...
 *   } finally {
 *     lock.unlock();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * So, it is all about being able to "box" the locks.
 * <p>
 * Caveat No 1: When a lock is "upgraded" from shared to exclusive, it remains exclusive until the matching unlock.
 * <p>
 * Previous behaviour: <s>Once you "upgrade" from shared to exclusive lock, you will possess exclusive lock as long as
 * your last {@link #unlock()} is invoked! While this is not totally correct or natural with "expectations", it does fit
 * it's purpose for use in Nexus.</s>
 * <p>
 * Caveat No 2: The "upgrade" is not atomic, and it is actually not even meant to be atomic. If you take a peek at
 * implementation, by acquiring an exclusive lock, you actually give away all your shared locks, and just then tries to
 * acquire the exclusive lock! By releasing shared lock, you might actually let some other thread, that was waiting for
 * exclusive lock do something. Thus, only after acquiring exclusive lock you are assured that the path content state is
 * unchanged (ie. you should check for it's existence if you want to append to it).
