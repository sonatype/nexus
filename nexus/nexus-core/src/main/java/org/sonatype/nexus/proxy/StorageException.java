/**
 * Generic storage exception thrown by given storage implementation (like IOExceptions), and so. Denotes a (probably)
 * unrecoverable, serious system and/or IO error. <b>This class is deprecated, and will be removed in future
 * releases!</b> The StorageException was used in more then half of cases to "wrap" an IOException and that did not make
 * any sense. IOException will replace the StorageException usage, but internally, two descendants of IOExceptions,
 * LocalStorageException and RemoteStorageException should be used to "fine tune" Nexus Core behavior.

 * @author cstamas
 * @deprecated Use {@link LocalStorageException} or {@link RemoteStorageException} respectively.
