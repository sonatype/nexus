/**
 * The event fired on Expiring Not Found cache.
 * <p>
 * Deprecation note: for historical reasons, before Nexus 1.4, there was only one method {@code expireCaches()}. After
 * Nexus 1.4 we separated out the "purge NFC" part of it into a new method {@code expireNotFoundCaches()}, but the
 * actual event being fired on those two were never split. Today, we are adding new event but also providing all the
 * needed bits to keep backward compatible code in place. See newly added {@link RepositoryEventExpireNotFoundCaches}
 * and {@link RepositoryEventExpireProxyCaches}.
 * <p>
